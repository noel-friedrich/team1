Illuminated manuscripts are handwritten books that have been decorated with elaborate designs, ornamentation, and illustrations, typically created during the Middle Ages. These manuscripts served both practical and artistic purposes, reflecting the cultural, religious, and intellectual life of the time. The term 'illuminated' derives from the use of gold or silver leaf, as well as vibrant colors, to enhance the texts and drawings, making the works visually striking.

The practice of creating illuminated manuscripts flourished from the 6th to the 16th centuries in Europe, particularly in monasteries where monks painstakingly copied and decorated religious texts. Key examples include the Book of Kells, the Lindisfarne Gospels, and various psalters and prayer books, each showcasing unique styles and regional influences.

Different regions developed their own characteristics in manuscript illumination. For instance, Irish and Anglo-Saxon manuscripts are known for their intricate interlace patterns and vibrant color palettes, while Italian works of the Renaissance tend to exhibit greater depth and perspective in their illustrations. These stylistic differences offer insights into the cultural exchanges and artistic evolutions of their respective periods.

Illuminated manuscripts not only served as religious texts but also as symbols of wealth and education. They were often commissioned by nobility or religious institutions, highlighting the importance of literature and art in society. The spread of the printing press in the 15th century led to a decline in the production of illuminated manuscripts, as printed books became more accessible and affordable.

Today, illuminated manuscripts are invaluable to scholars and art historians, providing a window into medieval life, beliefs, and artistic endeavors. Many of these treasures are preserved in libraries and museums, where they continue to be studied and appreciated for their beauty and historical significance. The tradition of manuscript illumination has seen a revival in modern times through various art forms, reflecting a renewed interest in craftsmanship and heritage.
